pulp-to-lua Â© NaOH 2022.

Different terms apply for pulp-to-lua vs. projects created with pulp-to-lua.

(1) For the purpose of transpiling pulp projects for which you are an author or for which you have the authority to do so, or for your own personal use,
    there are no restrictions as to the use of pulp-to-lua (even if your game is sold commercially). It would be kind to credit pulp-to-lua and perhaps
    its primary author (NaOH), but that is not necessary.
(2) outside of (1), the pulp-to-lua may not be used, nor may any portion of its source code be reproduced, for any reason other than personal use or for
    the purpose of contributing to the pulp-to-lua project.
(3) pulp-to-lua may be used by one party on behalf of another, but the following restrictions apply:
    - the source code for pulp-to-lua must be made available upon request,
    - it should be made clear that the source code is freely available,
    - no one shall charge payment for the use of pulp-to-lua

Exemptions to these terms may be granted only by express written permission from the primary author (NaOH).
